# Time-series-Model
Time Series Using SARIMAX Model


Using Death Drawning Data around the world in all countries and forcasting the death rate by drawning

Using many techniques like (ARIMA & SARIMA & MA ) etc....


Using Traditional libraries (Matplotlib & Pandas & Numpy )
And Using (Statsmodels library)





# Data 
                                              
Dataset shows the dead people rate (one per hundred of thousand) in 195 countries from all around the world and using this data in time series analysis to show results and get the reasons for increasing the drowning people rate in some countries.
According to this model analysis, we notice that death rate increases in developing countries, which has few technologies and resources 
It is noticed that the rate of death decrease over the years that means that people get more adaptation and they have more technologies and modern tools to deal with this
